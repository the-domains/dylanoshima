Commonly known as the rugby enthusiast in ISAK, Wataru Sado has a passion for this gentleman sport, which he began playing when he was 9 years old during his friend's birthday party. With his friend's father being a rugby coach, Wataru was recommended to play this sport competitively. From then on, Wataru joined the school team and began to compete in rugby tournaments. However, his love for the sport has not always been constant. Wataru loved the sport during his first year playing it in Thailand, but hated playing it for the next two years in Japan. Today, however, Wataru has loved rugby for five years and running. 

While most people may see rugby as a rough, rigorous physical sport, Wataru likes to see it as a sport played by gentlemen. He believes that it is a very safe sport as the players are trained how to tackle and be tackled without attaining too many injuries. Moreover, he has only met polite rugby players who fight a good fight on the field, but bring teams closer outside of the field. He believes that rugby has united many people and has allowed him to interact with people he would have never talked to if he did not play the sport. Another aspect of Wataru's love for rugby is that it is not only about the sport, but also about the atmosphere rugby creates within his team. 

Like any athlete, food is very important. For Wataru, without food he would not be able to literally move. To him, skipping one of the three meals would result in him being very sleepy and stiff. Once, during a break, Wataru slept in and skipped a meal. Upon waking up, he realised that he was not able to move out of his bed. Due to his firm belief that food is a necessity, he has never skipped a meal in ISAK, including breakfast. Do not be surprised if Wataru eats an entire tub of rice in one day, as this is the amount he used to eat in his home on a daily basis; he even has the capacity to eat dinner for 3 hours straight.

With regards to the future, Wataru has yet to find a clear objective, but he has come up with a few ideas. Since rugby is his passion, he wishes to become a professional rugby player because he thinks it would be cool to become an athlete and have a personal trainer. Alternatively, he also has his eyes set on possibly becoming a teacher. Whatever he chooses, we wish him the best of luck.
