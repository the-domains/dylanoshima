KANNA TWISK ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/433b5c2a-cce9-4ff6-866f-dd0f4c101e5a.jpg)

> "Listen to the words you can't hear and look for the things you can't see."

The cute, adorable, and always red-faced Kanna, has described herself to not be loud, but rather talkative. Although, when she senses that people are not very interested in the topics she is talking about, she will tend to shut down. She does not like it when she is alone, though she would not mind if someone she is talking to has to go somewhere. 

Something in which you may not know about Kanna is that she is 

terrified

of the dark. Even with the short distance between Girls' House 3 and Girls' House 2, she would be terrified. Actually, when she reaches the staircase of her house, she would increase her pace rapidly, in order to reach the door handle and see the beauty of light. Although, she does love looking at stars, which calms her from her fear of the dark. 

From sports to music to shopping to talking, she has an interest in multiple hobbies. Therefor, she tends to have an open-mind to multiple activities and willing to try almost anything. This is probably why she took on the initiative to learn to play the violin. She was 4 years old when she began to take lessons and through her hard work, she became the second best violinist in Holland. Initially, Kanna hated practicing the violin, though she is glad she learned to play because the violin gave her opportunities. Furthermore, playing the violin gave her an edge, the appreciation for classical music, a genre many teenagers tend to ignore. 

********

Currently, Kanna is interested in human behavior. Though it is not about how people act, but rather the reason to why they act this way. Even though two different fortune tellers have told her that she will become a nurse, she wants to possibly pursue a career in understanding human behavior. This is just a slice of Kanna Twisk and she is open to sharing more.
