 <p></p><p>Hana describes herself as a paradox. She explains that she is either really quiet, or if with someone she is closer to, extremely loud. Basically, Hana describes herself to always be an extreme of something. Moreover, she says she is a perfectionist, but also a procrastinator, which in her perspective is the worst mix and is a huge problem. </p><p></p><p>Hana came from a school where perfection equaled to success, which is probably why she has come to become a perfectionist. Although, she has come to realize that in order to become better at something, you must first enjoy it and be passionate about it. Therefore, she hopes to become who improves rather than worrying about perfection. Hobbies-wise, Hana has found her interest in dance and visual arts once she came to ISAK. Ever since she was young, she has always liked the arts though it has yet to fully blossom into a passion. Although, due to her hectic life, like all IB students, she currently does not have the time to enjoy what she loves to do. </p><p></p><p>Many may perceive Hana as very quite, sassy and at times scary, but do not let all of these labels fool you. There are times in which she may appear this way, though she is often very loud, friendly and a great listener. Though Hana may not actively share about herself, it is not because she is not open to share. On the contrary, Hana is actually very much open to sharing about who she is today, though it does require a sense of trust to the person she is telling herself about. </p><p><b id="docs-internal-guid-489459f8-cd64-ed65-09f3-69adbc3ca3a7"></b></p><p>What you may not know about Hana is that she is obsessed with tea. In her house, she actually has a box filled with tea bags just in case she needs an energy boost or something to relax herself. In regards to her future, Hana is possibly considering the field of psychology as she enjoys studying humans and the reason behind their actions. Moreover, she wishes to give a hand to those people who have been bullied before or is currently being bullied. This is because she has seen humans at their best and at their worst, and she wishes to be there to support them at any time. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Catalysm</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
